Images generated by the model after training for 400 epochs :

NOTE : The generated Images can be improved on further training but it may not be possible to remove the blur/noise factor from images generated by vanilla VAE,also all the training images resized to a lower resolution (60x60x3) which adds up the factor, using GAN networks or another VAE architecture can solve this issue.
